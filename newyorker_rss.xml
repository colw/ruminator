			<description><![CDATA[<p>On a recent weeknight in midtown Manhattan, the Broadway actor Kelvin Moon Loh led a rehearsal of “The Mikado,” one of the most popular works by the nineteenth-century duo W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. The two-act comic operetta, set in Edo-era Japan, is a satire of Victorian culture masquerading as a convoluted and kitschy love story. In the predominantly white world of American and British theatre, its Japanese characters have typically been played by white actors in wigs and kimonos, with tape-stretched eyes and kabuki-style makeup. But the show that Loh is assistant-directing, by the New York Gilbert &#38; Sullivan Players (N.Y.G.A.S.P.), does away with yellowface and exotic costumes, and features Asian-Americans both behind the curtain and onstage. In a baby-pink rehearsal space lined with mirrors, Loh, wearing jeans and a hoodie, led a pianist and forty-odd actors, many of them fresh off day jobs, through a complicated finale number. “What are you doing with those fans?” he asked a dozen women, as they practiced snapping open their props. He borrowed one from a lead and demonstrated. “Hold them like this, in the still position.&#8221;</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One morning in late August, at the peak of an unusually hot summer, I joined a group of scientists on the northern coast of Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula to perform a fish census. We trudged over a dike to a pristine beach just west of the mouth of the Elwha River. Chris Byrnes, a state biologist, and Sheri Washington, an intern with the nonprofit Coastal Watershed Institute (C.W.I.), rowed a small skiff into a shallow pond. Byrnes manned the oars while Washington let out the seine, a net embroidered with buoys along its top edge and lead weights along its bottom, which unfurled into the water like layers of meringue. Once the seine was in place, forming an underwater screen, four of us waded in bellybutton-deep, grabbed hold of its ends, and dragged it toward the shore.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Like many Americans, I first saw George Michael when he came blasting onto MTV alongside Andrew Ridgeley, in Wham!, in 1984. They wore white pants and white “CHOOSE LIFE” T-shirts, nearly glowing on a white stage, singing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIgZ7gMze7A">Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go</a>,” and it was utterly dazzling, a little baffling. “Jitterbug.” Snap, snap. “Jitterbug.” Snap, snap. The song started dizzily, urgently, with undertones of organ music. “You put the boom-boom into my heart,” Michael sang, with zippy oo-oos in the background. “You send my soul sky-high when your lovin’ starts.” Who was this beautiful man, with his beautiful hair, his beautiful face, his lashes, his two gold hoop earrings? What was happening? In sixth-grade lunchroom conversation, we tried to sort it out, but we couldn’t. All we knew, instinctively, was that this performer was giddy in his sense of himself, his voice, his craft, and so were we. Michael was rhyming “go-go” with “yo-yo” and telling somebody to stay in bed with him and hitting delirious high notes, and we were powerless to resist; we couldn’t stop dancing.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The legendary film editor Walter Murch made a case for the moving image as a sign of the times. “I think every age has a medium that talks to it more eloquently than the others,” he said in 2002. “In the nineteenth century, it was symphonic music and the novel. For various technical and artistic reasons, film became that eloquent medium for the twentieth century.” In these early years of the twenty-first century, it is digital video that has emerged as a contender for the medium of our age. We no longer have to seek out talking pictures at the theatre or even in our living rooms; they are always at the ready, embedded in social-media feeds and available anytime on the phones carried in our purses or pockets. Like film, video comprises sound and image, and it serves many different purposes. Video can be a captured memory, a document, a witness, a virus, a caper, a “universal dog whistle for joy,” as Carrie Battan <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/25/a-decade-in-viral-dance-moves">wrote</a> when describing videos of dance crazes shared through social media. Video can record the harrowing <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/topics/the-journey-from-syria-documentary">journey</a> of Syrian refugees making the perilous trek to Europe to seek a better life, or the dazzling <a href="http://video.newyorker.com/watch/goings-on-about-town-flight-of-the-pigeon">display</a> of thousands of pigeons outfitted with L.E.D. lights taking flight in the Brooklyn dusk.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual Next Wave Festival, as its name indicates, usually brings us work that is new, or new to New York. But in this year’s festival you could see Kyle Abraham’s “Pavement” looking very much as it did when it premièred, at Harlem Stage Gatehouse, four years ago. Nowadays, you don’t retire a dance that is both concerned with race and very good. In any case, this 2012 piece shows us, with no need of updating, that the circumstances underlying the Black Lives Matter movement preceded its actual founding, in 2013, in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s killer. Indeed, as Abraham has said, the dance was inspired by John Singleton’s movie “Boyz n the Hood,” now twenty-five years old. Singleton’s boys, all African-American, lived in South Central Los Angeles. Abraham’s are in Pittsburgh, his home town, and, interestingly, two of the six dancers are white. (One is a woman.) But the subject is the same: fear, and vigilance. If you’re a young person in one of this city’s black neighborhoods, you don’t have to do or be anything special in order to get killed. The score of “Pavement,” a montage of J. C. Bach, Jacques Brel, Sam Cooke, and many others, is punctuated by snippets of dialogue from “Boyz n the Hood.” Here’s one: “My mama say, ‘A bullet don’t have no name on it.’ ”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In a dream the other night, I was back in Beijing, at the entrance of my family’s apartment complex, where a public telephone, a black rotary, had once been guarded by the old women from the neighborhood association. They used to listen without hiding their disdain or curiosity while I was on the phone with friends; when I finished, they would complain about the length of the conversation before logging it in to their book and calculating the charge. In those days, I accumulated many errands before I went to use the telephone, lest my parents notice my extended absence. My allowance—which was what I could scrimp and save from my lunch money—was spent on phone calls and stamps and envelopes. Like a character in a Victorian novel, I checked our mail before my parents did and collected letters to me from friends before my parents could intercept them.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The hero of the new Jim Jarmusch film, “Paterson,” is named Paterson (Adam Driver). He lives in Paterson, New Jersey, with his wife, Laura (Golshifteh Farahani). Every day, Paterson wakes up early, has breakfast, leaves the house, and goes to work as a bus driver—piloting the No. 23, which says “paterson” on the front. He stops for lunch. At the end of the day, he comes home and eats dinner. Later, he takes his English bulldog for a walk, leaving it outside a bar while he goes in for a beer. For some reason, the mutt’s name is Marvin, which is ridiculous. It should be Paterson.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In late August, just as Donald Trump was making his improbable pitch to black voters (“What the hell do you have to lose?”), an unusual and tender video began to make the viral rounds. It showed Heather McGhee, the president of the progressive think tank Demos, responding to a caller on C-SPAN’s “Washington Journal.” McGhee is black. The caller was white, and, he said, prejudiced against black people, because of things he’d seen in the news. But he didn’t want to be. “What can I do to change?” he asked plaintively. “You know, to be a better American?” McGhee, moved, offered some advice: get to know black people, read up on black history, stop watching the nightly news. Eight million people viewed the video, leaving comments like “Hear, hear, hear every sweet, nourishing drop of that!”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Turkey’s Preacher <p>Dexter Filkins’s article on the Muslim scholar and preacher Fethullah Gülen, the founder of the social and religious movement Hizmet, of which I am a participant, misrepresents Gülen and leaves unchallenged a series of claims against him (“Turkey’s Thirty-Year Coup,” October 17th). Filkins refers to statements that Gülen made decades ago regarding Jews, but does not explain the evolution of his views, which Gülen has clarified in other interviews, or mention his consistent criticism of terrorist attacks in Israel and support for interfaith dialogue. Gülen has also repeatedly condemned the July 15th attempted coup against Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an, and he has vehemently denied any involvement. This article perpetuates many of the dangerous myths and false allegations against Gülen that President Erdo&#287;an has used to justify his authoritarian crackdown. Gülen is a peaceful, pro-democracy Muslim scholar and preacher. He has advocated for U.S. leadership in the world, for religious and cultural tolerance, and for women in leadership positions. He has been recognized by former leaders of Turkey as a Muslim intellectual committed to democracy, the rule of law, and moderate secularism.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!” The words of the Psalm look bright on the page, but the music pulls them into shadow. The key is G minor. The bass instruments drone on the tonic while the violins weave sixteenth notes around the other notes of the triad. On the third beat of the first bar comes a twinge of harmonic pain—one oboe sounding an E-flat against another oboe’s held D. Oboes are piercing by nature; to place them a half step apart triggers an aggressive acoustic roughness, as when car horns lean on adjacent pitches. In the next several bars, more dissonances accumulate, sustaining tension: F-sharp against G, A-flat against G, E-flat against D, B-flat against A-natural. The ensemble wanders away from the home key and then back, whereupon the cycle begins again, now with a chorus singing “Herr, unser Herrscher” (“Lord, our ruler”) in chords that contract inward:</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who came to power in a coup that, in its aftermath, resulted in the massacre of more than a thousand supporters of his predecessor, has a reputation for speaking very softly. This quality often disarms foreigners. “When you talk to him, unlike most generals, he listens,” a European diplomat told me recently. “He’s not bombastic.” An American official told me that Sisi reminds her of a certain Washington archetype. “You have the political people who always want to be the loudest voice in the room,” she said. “And then there are people who are creatures of the system, who are just as capable but not necessarily the loudest.” She said of Sisi, “I also think the quiet, reserved posture is a forcing function to make people lean in and really think about what he’s saying. What signal is he trying to send? Is there a deeper meaning?”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Evelyn Waugh, by Philip Eade (Henry Holt). This crowded, witty biography follows Waugh from the ancestral home in Somerset (“The only bathroom featured a stuffed monkey that had, improbably, died of sunstroke”) to the jungles of Brazil. The supporting characters seem stranger, blunter, and more lovable, or hateable, than their doubles in “Decline and Fall” and “Vile Bodies”—in this case, life exceeded art. Eade plunges into correspondence and unpublished family papers to explore the writer’s obsessions with social status and Catholicism, his jackknife turns from affection to contempt, and his torturous ambition. “I know I have something in me,” a young Waugh wrote, “but I am desperately afraid it may never come to anything.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ruth Draper was born in New York in 1884. When she was very young, she entertained her siblings by sitting on a window seat in the nursery of her family’s brownstone, on East Forty-seventh Street, and imitating grownups they knew, among them the tailor who made their clothes. By the time she was in her mid-thirties, she was performing, alone, on stages all over the world. She wrote all her own material. She abhorred publicity and gave virtually no interviews until the end of her life, when a new manager insisted, yet she filled theatres, often for long runs, on Broadway, in the West End, and elsewhere. Uta Hagen went to see her sixty times. The English critic Bernard Levin wrote that she induced “real hallucination” in her audiences, making them see characters who weren’t there.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On the morning of August 7, 2014, a team of fighters from the Islamic State, riding in pickup trucks and purloined American Humvees, swept out of the Iraqi village of Wana and headed for the Mosul Dam. Two months earlier, ISIS had captured Mosul, a city of nearly two million people, as part of a ruthless campaign to build a new caliphate in the Middle East. For an occupying force, the dam, twenty-five miles north of Mosul, was an appealing target: it regulates the flow of water to the city, and to millions of Iraqis who live along the Tigris. As the ISIS invaders approached, they could make out the dam’s four towers, standing over a wide, squat structure that looks like a brutalist mausoleum.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In March of 2016, a twenty-seven-year-old Syrian refugee named Rakan Ghebar began discussing his mental health with a counsellor. Ghebar, who has lived in Beirut since 2014, lost a number of family members to the civil war in Syria and struggles with persistent nervous anxiety. Before he fled his native country, he studied English literature at Damascus University; now, in Lebanon, he works as the vice-principal at a school for displaced Syrian children, many of whom suffer from the same difficulties as he does. When Ghebar asked the counsellor for advice, he was told to try to focus intently on the present. By devoting all of his energy to whatever he was doing, the counsellor said, no matter how trivial, he could learn to direct his attention away from his fears and worries. Although Ghebar sometimes found the instruction hard to follow, it helped him, and he shared it with his students.</p>]]></description>

And so, instead of the usual “best of,” I’ve decided to create a list of classic psychology papers and findings that can explain not just the rise of Donald Trump in the U.S. but also the rising polarization and extremism that seem to have permeated the world. To do this, I solicited the opinion of many leading psychologists, asking them to nominate a paper or two, with a brief explanation for their choice. (Then I nominated some stories myself.)

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“The reason why I said yes was because I am tired of being afraid,” Michelle Obama told a crowd in Council Bluffs, Iowa, during the State Fair, in August of 2007, explaining why she had signed on to a long-shot campaign to elect her husband, Barack Obama, President of the United States. She stood in a middle-school gym, surrounded by a mostly white audience that was only beginning to know her husband and had an even vaguer idea of who she was. The stage was a small, low platform, but Obama, dressed in black pants and T-shirt, with her hair pulled back in a bun, occupied it like a dancer, punctuating her seven-minute address with appealing turns and pauses, as her listeners responded. The decision to run, she said, had not been an easy one, particularly with two young daughters, and as she and her husband discussed it with others she had noticed a common theme. “They were afraid,” she said. There was “fear that we might lose. Fear that he might get hurt. Fear that this would be ugly. Fear that it would hurt our family.”</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a dismal-looking picture: “The Forgotten Man,” painted, in 2010, by the Utah-based artist Jon McNaughton and bought, last month, by the Fox host Sean Hannity. But, then, dismalness is its subject. With the White House in a crepuscular background, its flag at half-staff, all forty-four U.S. Presidents are gathered behind and to the sides of a hunky, hangdog young white guy, who sits on a park bench. He is, in the artist’s words, “distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future.” The proximate cause of his blues is a smug Barack Obama, who appears in the scene with arms folded as he steps on the first page of the Constitution. The ground is littered with dollar bills—a reference to excessive government spending. (The painting was occasioned, McNaughton <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/anti-obama-art-selling-for-six-figures?utm_term=.oeJNaNYWbe#.jlZjpjnqKQ">told BuzzFeed</a>, by the Affordable Care Act.) Most of the former chief executives look on blandly, but some heroes among them—mainly Washington, Lincoln, and Reagan—react with evident concern for the young guy and with dismay toward Obama, while a few villains, notably F.D.R. and Bill Clinton, applaud. James Madison leans forward, seemingly bent on rescuing the Constitution from ignominy.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Will Putin Unite the European and American Right?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For several years now, Vladimir Putin has been offering himself up as a helpful big brother to the parties of the European far right, and they’ve responded with expressions of warm family feeling. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s anti-immigrant, anti-European Union National Front, has praised Putin’s strong leadership and defended Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Le Pen sees allies in both Putin and Donald Trump, as well as in parties on the right in Europe, all united in a worldwide fight to reinforce national borders and resist globalization. &#8220;The forces at work in these various elections are ideas, forces which could bring about my election as the President of France next May,” she said last month. Among the forces she may have in mind are the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has said that he sees Putin’s Russia as a model of the “illiberal democracy” he’s installing at home. A former leader of Germany’s National Democratic Party, Udo Voigt, said recently, “We need a chancellor like Putin, someone who is working for Germany and Europe like Putin works for Russia.” And just this week Austria’s xenophobic Freedom Party, which was founded in the nineteen-fifties by former Nazis, signed a five-year “coöperation agreement” with Putin’s party, United Russia. The two parties will be partners in business development, the agreement promises, but also in “the education of the young generation in the spirit of patriotism and arbeitsfreude”—that is, “joy in work,” a term that dates to the nineteenth century but enjoyed a revival under the Nazis. Pyotr Tolstoy, the deputy speaker of the Duma, said that this bold coöperation between Russia’s ruling party and Europe’s anti-establishment conservatives would be a counterweight—this might sound familiar—to the “politically correct world, when everyone is hiding their real thoughts and feelings.” All in all, it has been an upbeat moment for Le Pen and her friends, with the potential, according to Lawrence Rosenthal, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who heads a center on right-wing studies, for an “international comity that the right has not historically had.”</p>]]></description>
